# Phishing URL Attack Detection with Chatbot UI

## Overview

This project implements a **Phishing URL Detection System** integrated with a **Chatbot UI**, allowing users to input URLs and receive real-time feedback on whether the URL is a phishing attempt or safe. The backend uses a machine learning model to analyze the URL's structure and content for indicators of phishing. The Chatbot UI provides a user-friendly interface to check URLs for potential phishing threats.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Phishing Detection**: Detects malicious and suspicious URLs that might be phishing attempts.
- **Interactive Chatbot UI**: User-friendly interface that allows users to check URLs via a chatbot.
- **Risk Scoring**: Displays a risk score based on URL analysis.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Explains why a URL was flagged as phishing or marked as safe.
- **Suggestions for Safe Browsing**: Recommends actions users should take to stay safe online.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the chatbot interface.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js for URL processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for building the phishing URL detection model.
- **URL Reputation APIs**: Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, or custom API for verifying URL reputation.
- **Database**: SQLite, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL (optional) for storing phishing URL patterns or user interactions.
- **Styling**: CSS (SASS/LESS) or TailwindCSS for UI styling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for React frontend)
- **Python** (for backend model processing and ML script)
- **pip** (for installing Python packages)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-url-chatbot.git
cd phishing-url-chatbot
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend (Chatbot UI)

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Run the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

Your frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Set Up the Backend (Phishing URL Detection Model)

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python libraries:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the backend server (using Flask/Django or other frameworks):

```bash
python app.py
```

The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Testing the Chatbot

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. In the chatbot UI, you can:

- Input any URL to check for phishing.
- Receive immediate feedback on whether the URL is safe or potentially malicious.
- Get suggestions for safe browsing practices.

## How It Works

### 1. URL Input

The user inputs a URL into the chatbot interface, which is sent to the backend for analysis.

### 2. URL Analysis

The backend uses the following techniques to detect phishing:

- **Machine Learning**: The model analyzes the URL using trained algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) to identify phishing patterns.
- **Heuristic Rules**: Common phishing techniques such as misleading domain names, suspicious keywords, or missing HTTPS are checked.
- **External APIs**: URL reputation is verified using services like **Google Safe Browsing** and **PhishTank**.

### 3. Results

- **Safe**: The chatbot responds that the URL is safe, with details of the analysis.
- **Suspicious**: If the URL is flagged as phishing, the chatbot shows a warning and provides an explanation of why it was flagged (e.g., suspicious domain, lack of SSL certificate).
  
The chatbot may also provide a **risk score** (e.g., 0-100), indicating the likelihood of the URL being malicious.

### 4. Further Actions

If the URL is detected as phishing:
- The chatbot may suggest actions like not visiting the site, reporting it, or checking other suspicious links.
- It may also provide best practices for staying safe online, such as verifying the authenticity of the URL before clicking.

## Example Interaction

1. **User**: *Inputs URL `http://example-phishing.com` into the chatbot.*
2. **Chatbot**: *"Checking URL... Please wait..."*
3. **Chatbot**: *"Warning: This URL is flagged as a phishing attempt. The domain is suspicious and does not match the official site. Risk Score: 85/100. Please do not visit this site."*
4. **Chatbot**: *"For your safety, consider reporting this URL to PhishTank and avoid entering any personal information on unknown websites."*

## Model Training and Customization

### 1. Training the Model

The machine learning model for phishing URL detection is built using a dataset of known phishing URLs and safe URLs. You can train your own model by following these steps:

- **Step 1**: Collect a dataset of phishing and safe URLs.
- **Step 2**: Use feature extraction techniques like domain analysis, URL structure analysis, and SSL certificate validation.
- **Step 3**: Train a model using Scikit-learn or another library (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Step 4**: Fine-tune the model and save it using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment.

```python
import joblib
# Example for saving a trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'phishing_model.pkl')
```

### 2. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable phishing detection.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```
